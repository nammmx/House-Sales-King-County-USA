# House-Sales-King-County-USA
Hey there! I am new to Data Science, so please review my work. Any kind of feedback is welcomed!

The purpose of this notebook is to gain a deeper understanding of linear regression by applying it to the "House Sales in King County" dataset. I will aim to archieve the highest possible prediction score by checking the underlying assumptions of a linear regression model and taking appropiate actions if needed. The following steps were taken:

1. Data Preparation
2. Regression
3. Check Model Adequacy
